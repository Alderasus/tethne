In this study, NPP<inf>gap</inf> was introduced into the present human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) framework. We introduced NPP<inf>gap</inf> in this study as potential NPP (NPP<inf>pot</inf>) minus the sum of ecosystem NPP (NPP<inf>eco</inf>) and HANPP, which relates to the ability of models to depict NPP components. Using the Lhasa River region of the Tibetan Plateau, we examined temporal and spatial variations in the components of NPP over a 10-year period. Results showed that NPP<inf>pot</inf>, HANPP and NPP<inf>eco</inf> increased from 2000 to 2010, but at different rates and with different spatial patterns. NPP<inf>gap</inf> each year ranged from -9.2% to 13.1% for each site and on average composed 1.2% of the total NPP<inf>pot</inf>. NPP<inf>gap</inf> was significantly correlated with precipitation, plant biodiversity, plant height and soil properties. NPP<inf>gap</inf> increased if either of the previous 2 years had been wet years with relative high precipitation. An increase in the richness of palatable species would lead to a larger NPP<inf>gap</inf> through more compensatory growth. The large fluctuation level of NPP<inf>gap</inf> reflected the higher stability of vegetation productivity, which is caused by higher plant heights and soil maximum water capacity. This study showed the potential of the HANPP framework in regional assessment of climate and human impacts on net primary productivity. The use of the NPP<inf>gap</inf> measure reflects the gap in our knowledge and our ability to accurately estimate the components of NPP. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We tested for the first time, the effects of microbial endophytes on growth and leaf-level physiology of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) under a moderate drought preconditioning and a successive severe drought stress. Burkholderia phytofirmans strain PsJN-inoculated switchgrass plants were 23.6% taller (p < 0.0001) and possessed 116% more tillers (p < 0.0001) during the moderate drought. Pre-drought conditioned PsJN-inoculated switchgrass had higher photosynthetic rates (Ps) at all levels of water stress; whereas, control switchgrass only benefited from pre-drought when leaf water potential (LWP) dropped below -1 MPa. Both PsJN inoculation and drought stress accelerated the leaf senescence and the strain promoted tillering/height ratio, which indicated more rapid development. In sum, enhancement of drought tolerance of switchgrass by PsJN was indicated by this study. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Burkholderia phytofirmans strain PsJN; Drought stress; Leaf water potential; Photosynthesis; Pre-drought conditioning; Switchgrass","Burkholderia phytofirmans; Panicum virgatum",,,,,,"Agnew, M., Carrow, R., Soil compaction and moisture stress preconditioning in Kentucky bluegrass.

Fruit, flower, and essential oil scents have found place in cosmetics, soaps, candles, and food amongst many common household products. With their increasing global demand and difficulty in extractation from the natural source, alternative methods of their production are being sought. One sustainable method is to employ microorganisms for the production of these high value compounds. With the tools of metabolic engineering, microorganisms can be modified to produce compounds such as esters, terpenoids, aldehydes, and methyl ketones. Approaches and challenges for the production of these compounds from microbial hosts are discussed in this review. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Essential oils; Ketones; Metabolic engineering; Microbiology; Microorganisms; Odors; Oils and fats; Global demand; Household products; Methyl ketones; Microbial production; Natural products; Natural sources; Terpenoids; Flavor compounds; 2,3 butanedione; acetoin; acetone; alcohol; alcohol derivative; aldehyde; cinnamic acid; ester; flavoring agent; fragrance; glutamic acid; limonene; myrcene; para coumaric acid; phenylpropanoid derivative; terpene; terpenoid; unclassified drug; vanillin; biotechnological production; feedback system; large scale production; metabolic engineering; microbial metabolism; nonhuman; photosynthesis; priority journal; process optimization; productivity; Review; signal transduction",,"2,3 butanedione, 431-03-8; acetoin, 513-86-0; acetone, 67-64-1; alcohol, 64-17-5; cinnamic acid, 4151-45-5, 538-42-1, 621-82-9; glutamic acid, 11070-68-1, 138-15-8, 56-86-0, 6899-05-4; limonene, 138-86-3, 5989-27-5; myrcene, 123-35-3; para coumaric acid, 7400-08-0; vanillin, 121-33-5",,,,"(2014) Flavors and Fragrances.

Thus, we carried out three experiments where we measured instantaneous gas exchange rates (net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance to water) under different light conditions. In the first experiment, individuals from both species were subjected to a moderate but constant level of irradiance. In the second one, every individual received a certain light dose through several periods of time characterized by different levels of constant irradiance. Finally, in the third experiment, dark periods of increasing duration were imposed to plants at steady-state of their gas exchange response, under the same level of irradiance employed in the first experiment. We used the time record of the data collected to calculate the total amount of C fixed and the water ""lost"" in each situation. Both species differed in their intrinsic ability for C fixation and avoidance of water loss, but showed a similar response with respect to the ratio between C fixed and water lost under different circumstances, what suggests that regulation of gas exchange in both species tends to keep this ratio constant under varying light conditions, playing light a critical role as an environmental signal for maximizing water use efficiency. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","C fixation; Circum-Mediterranean firs; Instantaneous gas exchange; Light-use efficiency; Water loss; Water-use efficiency","Abies; Abies pinsapo",,,,,,"Ackerly, D., Community assembly, niche conservatism, and adaptive evolution in changing environments (2003) Int.

The temperature of waterlogging was shown to be an important factor controlling plant reaction to this stress. Photosynthetic apparatus response to water excess in the soil at low temperature was examined in Festuca pratensis genotypes with contrasting freezing tolerance. The study was aimed to test the hypothesis whether changes in leaf water-soluble carbohydrate concentration brought about alterations in Rubisco activity may affect the photoacclimation to cold under water excess in the soil. The study investigated the effects of waterlogging during cold acclimation process on a set of chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, water-soluble carbohydrates, expression of Rubisco activase gene, and Rubisco activity. It was shown that carbohydrate status affected by Rubisco activity might be crucial for the activation of non-photochemical mechanism of photoacclimation to cold under waterlogging. Altered Rubisco activity was only partially attributed to the expression of Rubisco activase gene. Additionally, low carbohydrate concentration in the leaves of waterlogged plants was the condition preventing sugar repression of photosynthesis, including RcaA expression. This indicates that sugar de-repression of photosynthetic genes may be considered a component of photosynthetic acclimation to cold under waterlogging. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Chlorophyll fluorescence; Low temperature waterlogging; Rubisco activase; Rubisco activity; Water-soluble carbohydrates","Festuca pratensis",,,,,,"Adams, W.W., Muller, O., Cohu, C.M., Demmig-Adams, B., Photosystem II efficiency and non-photochemical fluorescence quenching in the context of source-sink balance (2014) Non-Photochemical Quenching and Energy Dissipation in Plants, Algae and Cyanobacteria, pp. 503-529. , Springer, Netherlands; An, Y.-Q., McDowell, J.M., Huang, S., McKinney, E.C., Chambliss, S., Meagher, R.B., Strong, constitutive expression of the Arabidopsis ACT2/ACT8 actin subclass in vegetative tissues (1996) Plant J., 10, pp. 107-121; Armstrong, W., Drew, M.C., Root growth and metabolism under oxygen deficiency (2002) Plant Roots: the Hidden Half, pp. 729-761. , Marcel Dekker, New York, Y.

Subtle changes in duckweed plant number, biomass production, and leaf area size induced by 10-day-exposure to diclofenac (DCF) and paracetamol (PCT) (0.1, 10, and 100. μg/L), excepting 100. μg/L DCF, are in contrast with considerable changes on biochemical and histochemical level. Both drugs caused a decrease in content of photosynthetic pigments (by up to 50%), an increase in non-photochemical quenching (by 65%) and decrease in relative chlorophyll fluorescence decay values (by up to 90% with DCF). Both DCF and especially PCT increased amount of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species in roots. DCF-induced effects included mainly increased lipid peroxidation (by 78%), disturbation in membrane integrity and lowering both oxidoreductase and dehydrogenase activities (by 30%). PCT increased the content of soluble proteins and phenolics. Higher concentrations of both DCF and PCT increased the levels of oxidised ascorbate (by 30%) and oxidised thiols (by up to 84% with DCF). Glutathion-reductase activity was elevated by both pharmaceuticals (nearly by 90%), glutathion- S-transferase activity increased mainly with PCT (by 22%). The early and sensitive indicators of DCF and PCT phytotoxicity stress in duckweed are mainly the changes in biochemical processes, connected with activation of defense mechanisms against oxidative stress. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Antioxidant mechanism; Diclofenac; Lemna minor; Oxidative stress; Paracetamol","Enzyme activity; Forestry; Oxidative stress; Photosynthesis; Plants (botany); Antioxidant mechanisms; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Diclofenac; Environmental risk assessment; Lemna minor; Non-photochemical quenching; Paracetamol; Reactive nitrogen and oxygen species; Risk assessment; chlorophyll; diclofenac; lipid; oxidoreductase; paracetamol; polyphenol derivative; reactive nitrogen species; reactive oxygen metabolite; abiotic stress; Article; bioaccumulation; chlorophyll fluorescence; contamination; controlled study; ecotoxicology; electron transport; enzymatic degradation; enzyme activity; Lemna minor; lipid peroxidation; nonhuman; photosynthesis; phytotoxicity; plant stress; quantum yield; respiratory chain; risk assessment; thylakoid membrane; Lemna; Lemna minor",,"chlorophyll, 1406-65-1, 15611-43-5; diclofenac, 15307-79-6, 15307-86-5; lipid, 66455-18-3; oxidoreductase, 9035-73-8, 9035-82-9, 9037-80-3, 9055-15-6; paracetamol, 103-90-2",,,,"Yang, Y., Fu, J., Peng, H., Hou, L., Liu, M., Zhou, J.L., Occurrence and phase distribution of selected pharmaceuticals in the Yangtze Estuary and its coastal zone (2011) J.

This biological recycling of iron could enhance primary productivity in iron-limited waters. However, quantifying the effects of marine animals on ocean primary productivity remains challenging because of a limited understanding of the key biogeochemical processes involved. In this paper, we develop a preliminary model that explores these uncertainties and examines the potential effects of historical populations of blue, fin and humpback whales, and the biomass of Antarctic krill required to support the whale populations, on primary productivity in the Southern Ocean.Our results suggest that, despite conservative estimates for key processes in our model, pre-exploitation populations of blue whales and, to a lesser extent fin and humpback whales, could have contributed to iron recycling, resulting in enhanced phytoplankton production in iron-limited Southern Ocean waters. Iron-rich defecation by un-exploited whale populations in the Southern Ocean, and the biomass Antarctic krill required to support them, could have resulted in a contribution to primary productivity of between 1.5×10-4 to 23.4gCm-2yr-1 (blue whales), 1.4×10-4 to 13.9gCm-2yr-1 (fin whales), and 2.4×10-5 to 1.7gCm-2yr-1 (humpback whales). However, only when all parameter estimates are at their upper limits does there appear to be this significant role for whales in enhancing primary productivity, and thus we need to assess the likelihood of these values arising.The high degree of uncertainty around the magnitude of these increases in primary productivity is mainly due to our limited quantitative understanding of key biogeochemical processes. To reduce uncertainty regarding the effect of whales on Southern Ocean primary productivity, future research will need to refine our understanding of five influential model parameters: iron content in krill; krill consumption rates by whales; persistence of whale faecal iron in the photic zone; bioavailability of this retained iron; and the carbon-to-iron ratio of phytoplankton. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Antarctic krill; Iron; Preliminary model; Primary productivity; Southern Ocean; Whales","Animals; Biochemistry; Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Fins (heat exchange); Iron; Oceanography; Parameter estimation; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Recycling; Uncertainty analysis; Antarctic krill; Preliminary model; Primary productivity; Southern ocean; Whales; Iron research; Animalia; Balaenoptera musculus; Balaenoptera physalus; Cetacea; Euphausiacea; Megaptera; Mysticeti",,,,,,"Arrigo, K.R., van Dijken, G.L., Bushinsky, S., Primary production in the Southern Ocean, 1997-2006 (2008) J.

In this study we investigated causes of the seasonal alkalinisation of ephemeral wetlands in the South East of South Australia where pH values above 10 are frequently observed. This research combined field observations, geochemical analysis of wetland sediment and surface water, with mesocosm studies under controlled conditions. The results revealed a complex interplay between a number of different processes. A primary cause was attributed to sequestration of CO2 from the water column by plant photosynthesis, coupled with slow diffusion of CO2 from the air which led to its depletion in the water. Abundant plant growth also modified the water chemistry via uptake of nutrient elements, in particular calcium and magnesium and increased carbonate alkalinity in the water. Assessment of field results and geochemical modeling showed that low Ca/(HCO3 - and CO3 -2) ratios in the water, coupled with carbonate mineral (calcite, Mg substituted calcite, dolomite) precipitation and evapoconcentration, create a high alkalinity and pH (&gt;9) baseline in many wetlands. The high baseline pH is then further increased by CO2 depletion due to photosynthesis. We could find no evidence that reduction of sulfate to sulfides by sulfur-reducing bacteria significantly contributed to the very high pH conditions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Alkalinity; Geochemical models; Geochemistry; Macrophytes; Primary productivity; Soda lakes; Wetlands","Analytical geochemistry; Calcite; Calcium; Calcium carbonate; Carbon dioxide; Geochemistry; Lakes; Metabolism; pH; Photosynthesis; Surface waters; Wetlands; Aquatic photosynthesis; Calcium and magnesiums; Controlled conditions; Geochemical models; Macrophytes; Primary productivity; Soda lakes; Sulfur reducing bacterium; Alkalinity",,,,,,"Abd-el-Malek, Y., Rizk, S.G., Bacterial sulphate reduction and the development of alkalinity.

Moreover, the removal and kinetics of PhACs in CWs were evaluated to explore the related removal mechanisms. Results showed that C. alternifolius can uptake and withstand certain PhACs. The PhAC tolerance of C. alternifolius might be attributed to their capacity to maintain relatively normal photosynthetic activity and elevated antioxidative defense. CWs offered comparable or even higher removal efficiencies for the selected PhACs compared with conventional WWTPs. The removal of the target PhACs was enhanced in the planted CWs versus the unplanted CWs mostly because of plant uptake and rhizosphere effects. In particular, carbamazepine, which is considered the most recalcitrant of the PhACs, was significantly reduced (p< 0.05). The removal of target PhACs fitted into two distinct periods. The initial fast step (within the first 2 h) was essentially attributed to the adsorption onto the CW medium surface. The subsequent slow process (2-12 h) closely followed first-order kinetics probably because of the interaction between microorganisms and plants. The obtained results indicate that C. alternifolius can phytoremediate PhAC-contaminated waters in CWs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Antioxidant enzymes; Constructed wetland; Cyperus alternifolius; Pharmaceutically active compounds; Removal","Amides; Antioxidants; Enzymes; Removal; Soils; Water pollution; Antioxidant enzyme; Antioxidative defense; Constructed wetlands; Constructed wetlands (CWs); Cyperus alternifolius; Pharmaceutically active compounds; Photosynthetic activity; Toxicological response; Wetlands; antioxidant; carbamazepine; carotenoid; catalase; chlorophyll a; chlorophyll b; ofloxacin; peroxidase; roxithromycin; sulfamethoxazole; superoxide dismutase; adsorption; Article; constructed wetland; controlled study; Cyperus; Cyperus alternifolius; microcosm; nonhuman; photosynthesis; phytoremediation; plant metabolism; plant uptake; rhizosphere; surface property; waste component removal; waste water management; water contamination; water quality; Cyperus alternifolius",,"carbamazepine, 298-46-4, 8047-84-5; catalase, 9001-05-2; chlorophyll a, 479-61-8; chlorophyll b, 519-62-0; ofloxacin, 82419-36-1; peroxidase, 9003-99-0; roxithromycin, 80214-83-1; sulfamethoxazole, 723-46-6; superoxide dismutase, 37294-21-6, 9016-01-7, 9054-89-1",,"Sigma Aldrich, United States",,"Verlicchi, P., Al Aukidy, M., Zambello, E., Occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds in urban wastewater: removal, mass load and environmental risk after a secondary treatment - a review (2012) Sci.

Forestry activities are a key pressure on these catchments increasing suspended sediment and nutrient export to receiving waters. The aim of this study was to investigate stream dissolved oxygen (DO) and metabolic activity response following clearfelling of a 39-year-old lodgepole pine and Sitka spruce forestry in an upland peat catchment. Significant effects of clearfelling on water temperature, flows, DO and stream metabolic (photosynthesis, respiration) rates were revealed. Stream temperature and discharge significantly increased in the study stream following clearfelling. Instream ecosystem respiration increased significantly following clearfelling, indicating an increase in the net consumption of organic carbon. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Blanket peat catchments; Dissolved oxygen; Forest clearfelling; Stream metabolism; Temperature; Water quality","Picea sitchensis; Pinus contorta",,,,,,"(2005) Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, , American Public Health Association, Washington; Aristegi, L., Izagirre, O., Elosegi, A., Comparison of several methods to calculate reaeration in streams, and their effects on estimation of metabolism (2009) Hydrobiologia, 635, pp. 113-124; Arvola, L., Vertical distribution of primary production and phytoplankton in two small lakes with different humus concentration in southern Finland (1984) Ecography, 7 (4), pp. 390-398; Asam, Z., Kaila, A., Nieminen, M., Sarkkola, S., O'Driscoll, C., O'Connor, M., Sana, A., Xiao, L., Assessment of phosphorus retention efficiency of blanket peat buffer areas using a laboratory flume approach (2012) Ecol.

In order to counterbalance the costs required to operate massive microalgae cultivations, it is necessary to create additional revenues through biomass sales. This manuscript examines the techno-economics of microalgae cultivations for the integration with three power plant technologies using an artificial neural network model. The economics are estimated using the net present value approach. The assessment is carried out at photosynthesis efficiencies ranging from 2% to 6%. The sensitivity assessment shows microalgae selling prices in the range of $440-1028/t at a photosynthetic efficiency of 4% for low and high cost scenarios in order to achieve an electricity price similar to that from a conventional power plant without a CO2 capture and storage. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Artificial neural networks; CO2 bio-fixation; Microalgae cultivation; Photosynthetic efficiency; Solar radiation","Algae; Carbon; Costs; Economics; Efficiency; Microorganisms; Neural networks; Solar radiation; Alternative process; Artificial neural network modeling; Capital investment; Conventional power plants; Microalgae cultivation; Photosynthetic efficiency; Power plant technology; Techno-economic assessment; Investments",,,,,,"(2003) Conducting technical and economic evaluations - as applied for the process and utility industries TCM framework: 3.2 - asset planning, 3.3 - investment decision making, , AACE International Recommended Practice No. 16R-90; Acien Fernandez, F.G., Fernandez Sevilla, J.M., Molina Grima, E., Photobioreactors for the production of microalgae (2013) Rev Environ Sci Biotechnol, 12, pp. 131-151; Andersen, R.A., (2005) Algal culturing techniques, , Elsevier Academic Press; Aslan, S., Kapdan, I., Batch kinetics of nitrogen and phosphorus removal from synthetic wastewater by algae (2006) Ecol Eng, 28, pp. 64-70; Benemann, J., Microalgae for biofuels and animal feeds (2013) Energies, 6 (11), pp. 5869-5886; Bilanovic, D., Holland, M., Armon, R., Microalgal CO2 sequestering - modelling microalgae production costs (2012) Energy Convers Manage, 58, pp. 104-109; Brentner, L.B., Eckelman, M.J., Zimmerman, J.B., Combinatorial life cycle assessment to inform process design of industrial production of algal biodiesel (2011) Environ Sci Technol, 45, pp. 7060-7067; Brooker, B.D., (2011) Investigation of microalgae growth kinetics using coal-fired flue gas as a carbon source, , (Thesis), Master of Science in Engineering, The Faculty of California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo; Burgess, J., Jeffery, L., Lowe, A., Schuck, S., Flentje, W., (2011) Novel CO2 capture: taskforce report, , Project sponsored by BCIA, ANLEC R&D and the Global CCS Institute, Melbourne; Campbell, P.K., Beer, T., Batten, D., Greenhouse gas sequestration by algae: energy and greenhouse gas life cycle studies sustainability tools for a new climate (2009) Proc. 6th Australian life cycle assessment conference, , ALCAS, Melbourne; Chisti, Y., Biodiesel from microalgae (2007) Biotechnol Adv, 25, pp. 294-306; Davis, R., Aden, A., Pienkos, P.T., Techno-economic analysis of autotrophic microalgae for fuel production (2011) Appl Energy, 88, pp. 3524-3531; de Godos, I.C., Gonzalez, E., Becares, P.A., Simultaneous nutrients and carbon removal during pretreated swine slurry degradation in a tubular biofilm photobioreactor (2009) Appl Microbiol Biotechnol, pp. 187-194; Doucha, J., Lívanský, K., High density outdoor microalgal culture (2014) Algal biorefineries, pp. 147-173. , Springer Science+Business Media, Dordrecht, A.

The experiment was set up as a split plot design in completely randomized blocks design with three replications. Results showed that the stem water potential (ψstem) was directly related to the soil water deficit (SWD), and it varied from -2.07 to -3.27MPa in 2011 and -1.67 to -3.23MPa in 2012. In all times of measurements, higher values of stomatal conductance (gs), net photosynthesis (An) and leaf scale transpiration (Tr) were obtained in FI and mild water stress treatments (An: 3.15-12.64μmolm-2s-1, gs: 0.032-0.129molm2s-1 and Tr: 2.72-9.48mmolm2s-1) in comparion with those obtained in the severe water stress treatments (An: 2.11-11.81μmolm-2s-1, gs: 0.021-0.11molm2s-1 and Tr: 1.89-7.58mmolm2s-1). Results generally showed low values of gs in the Rabab cultivar in the studied arid area. Furthermore, the hydraulic signaling (ψstem) in response to the water stress and weather conditions controlled the seasonal variation of gs. Transpiration efficiency (TE) increased with increasing the degree of water stress and PRD showed higher TE (1.17-1.18μmolmmol-1) than that in DI strategies (1.06-1.07μmolmmol-1). Furthermore, the value of intrinsic water use efficiency (IWUE) in FI (85μmolmol-1) was statistically lower than that obtained in mild (PRD75, DI75) and severe (PRD50, DI50) water stress treatments (87.8-89.9μmolmol-1). Different irrigation strategies did not significantly affect the fruit growth rate, and its maximum values occurred at about 170 DAB (0.27-0.35mmd-1) in all irrigation strategies. The LAI values in FI and mild water stress strategies were significantly different compared with those in the severe water stress treatments. For all irrigation strategies, the maximum LAI values occurred at flowering stage (68 DAB), and was 6.09 and 6.15 (FI), 5.97 and 6.04 (DI75), 6.33 and 6.64 (PRD75), 4.60 and 4.82 (DI50) and 4.91 and 5.03m2m-2 (PRD50) in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In conclusion, PRD75 is the recommended, applicable water-saving strategy and good alternative with respect to FI among other irrigation managements when water resources are limited in order to increase TE and IWUE while other physiological and growth parameters are maintained at an acceptable level. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Leaf area index; Partial root zone drying irrigation; Photosynthesis; Stem water potential; Stomatal conductance","Drying; Efficiency; Forestry; Irrigation; Photosynthesis; Physiological models; Physiology; Soil moisture; Transpiration; Water conservation; Water resources; Intrinsic water-use efficiencies; Irrigation management; Leaf Area Index; Root zone; Split plot designs; Stem water potentials; Stomatal conductance; Transpiration efficiency; Plants (botany); Lythraceae; Punica granatum",,,,,,"Abrisqueta, J.M., Mounzer, O., Alvarez, S., Conejero, W., Garcia-Orellana, Y., Tapia, L.M., Vera, J., Ruiz-Sanchez, M.C., Root dynamics of peach trees submitted to partial root zone drying and continuous deficit irrigation (2008) Agric.

Three levels of nitrogen (0, 60 and 120kgNha-1) and three levels of soil water availability (rainfed, 50% ETm restitution and 100% ETm restitution) were compared. Throughout the crop growing season significant effects of soil water availability, nitrogen fertilization and time of measurement on net photosynthesis (A), transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (gs), canopy temperature (Tc), midday (ψM) and predawn leaf water potential (ψPD) were found. Significant interactions of soil water availability x time of measurement were also observed, while nitrogen x time of measurement was significant only for A, gs, E and ψM.Radiation use efficiency (RUE) was lowest in rainfed and no-nitrogen fertilization (1.40 and 1.26gMJ-1 in 1998 and in 1999, respectively) and highest in 100% ETm and 120kgNha-1 in both years (1.78 and 1.94gMJ-1 in 1998 and in 1999, respectively). The fraction of intercepted PAR approached the asymptote when leaf area index was greater than 4.0, irrespective of soil water availability and nitrogen fertilization. The extinction coefficient (k) ranged from 0.38 to 0.44.Present results may have practical applications to help maximize physiological performances with improved WUE, optimized resource use efficiency and reduced irrigation demands. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Bioenergy crop; Leaf water potential; Marginal land; Net photosynthesis; Perennial grass; RUE; Stomatal conductance; WUE","Arundo donax",,,,,,"Angelini, L.G., Ceccarini, L., Bonari, E., Biomass yield and energy balance of giant reed (Arundo donax L.) cropped in central Italy as related to different management practices (2005) Eur.

The plants were subjected to four different treatments (K0Na0, K0Na1, K1Na0 and K1Na1) and two different levels of humidity, low (40%) and high (80%), in chamber growth conditions. The plants' growth was higher under conditions of high relative humidity when compared to low humidity in all the treatments studied. The CO2 assimilation rate, transpiration and stomatal conductance were stimulated by high humidity independently of treatments of K+ and Na+. The Na+ concentration in the shoots was more elevated in plants treated with NaCl when compared to NaCl-free plants. On the other hand, the shoots' K+ concentration was highly stimulated in the presence of K+ ions, especially in combination with high relative humidity (RH). The shoots' Na+ transport rate was strongly stimulated by a combination of 50mM NaCl+40% RH when compared to high humidity. Conversely, the shoots' K+ transport was significantly higher in plants when they were supplied with K+ and exposed to high relative humidity. In the roots, the transport rate of Na+ presented a similar pattern to that found in the shoot. However, surprisingly, K+ transport rate was increased in plants supplied with K+ and 40% RH in NaCl absence. The plants exposed to low relative humidity showed lower K+/Na+ ratios than plants exposed to 80% RH both in shoots and roots. In addition, the shoots and roots selectivity (K,Na) was strongly stimulated in plants exposed to high humidity when compared to low humidity. In conclusion, the combined effects of high relative humidity and a supply of K+ were able to improve the growth, the leaf gas exchange and ionic homeostasis of J. curcas plants. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Ion transport; Ion uptake; Jatropha curcas; Relative humidity; Salinity","Atmospheric humidity; Carbon dioxide; Ion exchange; Ions; Physiological models; Physiology; Different treatments; High relative humidities; Ion transports; Ion uptake; Jatropha curcas; Low relative humidities; Physiological parameters; Salinity; Gas plants; Jatropha curcas",,,,,,"Akram, M.S., Akram, N.A., Akram, N.A., Effectiveness of potassium sulfate in mitigating salt-induced adverse effects on different physio-biochemical attributes in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.)

The model was based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in combination with support vector machines (SVMs). This optimization mechanism involved kernel parameter setting in the SVM training procedure, which significantly influences the regression accuracy. PSO-SVM-based models, which are based on the statistical learning theory, were successfully used here to predict the Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration (output variable) as a function of the following input variables: pH, optical density, oxygen concentration, nitrate concentration, phosphate concentration, salinity, water temperature and irradiance. Regression with three different kernels (linear, quadratic and RBF) was performed and determination coefficients of 0.94, 0.97, and 0.99, respectively, were obtained. The PSO-SVM-based model goodness of fit to experimental data (Chl-a concentration) confirmed the good performance of this model. Indeed, it is well-known that Chl-a is an extremely important biomolecule, critical in photosynthesis, which allows plants to obtain energy from light and it is one of the most often used algal biomass estimator. The model also allowed to know the most influent parameters in the growth of the S. platensis. Finally, conclusions of this study are exposed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Chlorophyll a monitoring; Hyperparameter selection; Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO); Spirulina platensis; Support vector machines (SVMs)","Chlorophyll; Density functional theory; Forecasting; Support vector machines; Chlorophyll a; Determination coefficients; Hyper-parameter; Oxygen concentrations; Phosphate concentration; Spirulina platensis; Statistical learning theory; Support vector machine (SVMs); Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",,,,,,"Richmond, A., (2004) Handbook of Microalgal Mass Culture, , CRC Press Boca Raton (FL); Belov, A.P., Giles, J.D., Dynamical model buoyant cyanobacteria (1997) Hydrobiology, 349 (1-3), pp. 87-97; Oswald, W.J., Current status of algae from wastes (1969) Chem.

The effect of nano-oxide type was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy measurements. The performance of LSC nanohybrid films was evaluated and optimized for photoselective greenhouse cladding applications in order to increase the plant productivity by changing the solar spectrum. It was found that ZnO nanohybrid LSC film had offered the best spectral properties for photosynthetic active radiation besides their excellent resistance to photo and thermal degradation especially in hot countries like KSA. Regarding thermal efficiency, the highest infrared (IR) efficiency has been found for silica nanohybrid LSC film, which reached about 83%. This result is promising to improve thermal efficiency in greenhouse claddings in cold regions and thermal covering systems like solar dryers and solar desalination systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Greenhouse photoselective film; Photostability; Photosynthesis; PMMA nanohybrid; Red fluorescence","Desalination; Efficiency; Fluorescence; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Free radicals; Greenhouses; Nanostructured materials; Oxide films; Photosynthesis; Solar radiation; Zinc oxide; Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectroscopy; Luminescent solar concentrators; Nano hybrids; Photo-stability; Photosynthetic active radiations; Red fluorescence; Solar desalination systems; Spectral distribution; Free radical polymerization; fluorescence; nanotechnology; optimization; performance assessment; photosynthesis; photosynthetically active radiation; polymerization; solar radiation; spectral analysis; thermoluminescence",,,,,,"Oaki, Y., Imai, H., Room-temperature aqueous synthesis of highly luminescent BaWO<inf>4</inf>-polymer nanohybrids and their spontaneous conversion to hexagonal WO<inf>3</inf> nanosheets (2006) Adv.

A solution culture study was performed during a two weeks time-course experiment. In addition its ability to recover in terms of photochemistry activity was examined, at the highest salinity level after seven days of rewatering with distilled water only. To quantify growth and physiological responses to salinity (NaCl), plants were divided into five treatments and grown across a range of salinities (0-600. mM). Although exposure to severe salinity stress 14 days after treatment (DAT) was sufficient to affect biomass fresh weight, dry weight production was not affected. The photon yield of PSII and non-photochemical quenching responded to the strength of the stress applied, whereas the maximum efficiency of PSII photochemistry declined only in the highest salinity stress level after 14 DAT. However, the rapid and full recovery of the main chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters upon rewatering confirms the hardy tolerance of the species to such stress conditions. Functional changes were observed in pigment and carbohydrate content and composition among different treatments, especially after 14 DAT. The use of multicanonical analysis revealed the canonical relationship between the treatment fingerprints obtained from biometric and physiological data. Overall, our dataset suggests the use of straight seawater or brackish water for this salt tolerant species, creating the opportunity to develop turfgrass landscapes in arid and seashore regions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Chlorophyll a fluorescence; Multiple factorial analysis; Paspalum vaginatum; Photosynthetic pigments; SeaSpray; Soluble sugars","Beaches; Biometrics; Chemical reactions; Chlorophyll; Fluorescence; Photosynthesis; Physiological models; Physiology; Recovery; Chlorophyll a fluorescence; Factorial analysis; Paspalum vaginatum; Photosynthetic pigments; Seaspray; Soluble sugars; Plants (botany); brackish water; chlorophyll a; cultivar; data set; factor analysis; grass; growth response; photochemistry; photosynthesis; physiological response; salinity; seawater; sodium chloride; sugar; tolerance; Paspalum vaginatum; Poaceae",,,,,,"Allahverdiyeva, Y., Aro, E.-M., Photosynthetic responses of plants to excess light: mechanisms and conditions for photoinhibition, excess energy dissipation and repair (2012) Photosynthesis: Plastid Biology, Energy Conversion and Carbon Assimilation, Advances in Photosynthesis and Respiration, pp. 275-297. , Springer, Netherlands, J.J.

Cyclic electron flow around photosystem I (CEF) is proposed to balance the ATP/NADPH budget by using reducing equivalents to drive plastoquinone reduction, leading to the generation of proton motive force and subsequent ATP synthesis. While high rates of CEF have been observed in vivo, isolated thylakoids show only very slow rates, suggesting that the activity of a key complex is lost or down-regulated upon isolation. We show that isolation of thylakoids while in the continuous presence of reduced thiol reductant dithiothreitol (DTT), but not oxidized DTT, maintains high CEF activity through an antimycin A sensitive ferredoxin:quinone reductase (FQR). Maintaining low concentrations (~ 2 mM) of reduced DTT while modulating the concentration of oxidized DTT leads to reversible activation/inactivation of CEF with an apparent midpoint potential of - 306 mV (±10 mV) and n = 2, consistent with redox modulation of a thiol/disulfide couple and thioredoxin-mediated regulation of the plastoquinone reductase involved in the antimycin A-sensitive pathway, possibly at the level of the PGRL1 protein. Based on proposed differences in regulatory modes, we propose that the FQR and NADPH:plastoquinone oxidoreductase (NDH) pathways for CEF are activated under different conditions and fulfill different roles in chloroplast energy balance. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Acetylcholine and the pivotal components of the cholinergic system (high affinity choline uptake, choline acetyltransferase and its endproduct acetylcholine, muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, cholinesterases) are expressed by more or less all mammalian cells, i.e., cells not innervated by neurons at all. Moreover, acetylcholine and cholinergic binding sites have been described in plants. Acetylcholine is even detected in bacteria and algae and thus represents an extremely old signaling molecule on the evolutionary time scale. The following chapter summarizes the detection of acetylcholine beyond neurons with particular emphasis on the presence of acetylcholine in so-called primitive organisms. Finally, an overview is given about the detection in mammalian non-neuronal cells. The existence of the non-neuronal cholinergic system has identified an important new target to illuminate the pathophysiological background of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases as well as heart diseases and cancer. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.","Bacteria; Epithelial–mesothelial–endothelial and immune cells; Evolution; HPLC combined with bioreactors and electrochemical detection; Non-neuronal acetylcholine; Non-neuronal cholinergic system; Plants; Signaling via muscarinic and nicotinic receptors; Unicellular organisms","acetylcholine; carnitine acetyltransferase; choline acetyltransferase; muscarinic receptor; muscarinic receptor blocking agent; nicotinic receptor; acetylcholine release; Article; asthma; autocrine effect; bioreactor; bronchodilatation; cell communication; cholinergic system; chronic obstructive lung disease; electrochemical detection; fluid balance; high performance liquid chromatography; human; mammal cell; nonhuman; paracrine signaling; pathophysiology; photosynthesis; plant; priority journal; radioimmunoassay; algae; Mammalia",,"acetylcholine, 51-84-3, 60-31-1, 66-23-9; carnitine acetyltransferase, 9029-90-7; choline acetyltransferase, 9012-78-6",,,,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine, Accessed 18 Jan 2015Liebreich, O., Über die chemische Beschaffenheit der Gehirnsubstanz (1864) Ann Chem Pharm, 54, pp. 29-44; Bayer, A., Synthese des Neurins (1867) Ann Chem Pharm, 140, pp. 306-313; Wessler, I., Non-neuronal acetylcholine, a locally acting molecule, widely distributed in biological systems: Expression and function in humans (1998) Pharmacol Ther, 77 (1), pp. 59-79; Wessler, I., The cholinergic ‘pitfall’: Acetylcholine, a universal cell molecule in biological systems, including humans (1999) Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol, 26 (3), pp. 198-205; Sastry, B.V., Sadavongvivad, C., Choli nergic systems in non-nervous tissues (1978) Phar Macol Rev, 30 (1), pp. 65-132; Dale, H.H., The action of certain esters and ethers of choline and their relation to muscarine (1914) J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 6, pp. 147-190; Ewins, A.J., Acetylcholine, a new active principle of ergot (1914) Biochem J, 8, pp. 44-49; Loewi, O., Über humorale Übertragbarkeit der Herznervenwirkung (1921) Plügers Arch, 189, pp. 239-242; Loewi, O., Navratil, E., Über humorale Übertragbarkeit der Herznervenwirkung.
