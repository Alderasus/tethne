Tethne
======
Tethne is a Python package for integrated bibliographic and corpus analysis developed by the Digital Innovation Group at Arizona State University. Tethne provides simple tools for generating networks from bibliographic datasets, and provides a framework for weaving together techniques from scientometrics, computational linguistics, topic modeling, and social influence modeling. Rather than reinvent or re- implement existing algorithms, Tethne is designed to interface with existing software packages, and to provide mechanisms for drawing the results and functionalities of those packages together.

Key features
------------
* Flexible core model for text and citation-data.
* Provides core analytic features of popular citation-analysis software (e.g. Citespace).
* Integrates popular topic modeling software (e.g. MALLET).
* Export network models to mainstream formats (e.g. for visualization in Cytoscape).
* Leverages powerful computational and network-analysis libraries in Python. 
* HDF5 data management for persistence and interoperability.
