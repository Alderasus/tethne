# Tethne
Tethne is a script for analyzing citation data. Right now it just works on data from the Web of Science, but hopefully it will be expanded to work on data from other sources as well. It generates a variety of networks, such as bibliographic coupling, citation, author-paper, and co-author networks, using networkx. 

## Warning
This code is hacked together in a short amount of time to serve my own (academic) purposes. I'm not a software developer, and the code is far from polished. If you have ideas about how to make this better, go right ahead and contribute some code.

## Requirements
[Python] [1]
[NetworkX] [2]
    
    [1]: http://www.python.org/         "Python"
    [2]: http://networkx.github.io/     "NetworkX"
    
I think that's it...
